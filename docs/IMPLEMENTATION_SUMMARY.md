# StashApp-PlayaVR Bridge - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully converted the PLAYA-API-v2 reference application from serving static sample data to a fully functional StashApp-PlayaVR bridge. This implementation provides real-time access to your StashApp video library through the PlayaVR application.

## Key Components Added

### 1. **StashApp Integration Service** (`Services/StashAppService.cs`)
- GraphQL client for StashApp API communication
- Video metadata fetching and conversion
- Category/tag management
- Health monitoring
- Automatic quality detection based on video resolution

### 2. **Video Streaming Controller** (`Controllers/StreamController.cs`)
- Proxies video streams from StashApp with authentication
- Handles HTTP range requests for proper video seeking
- Serves video thumbnails/posters
- Maintains PlayaVR compatibility

### 3. **Enhanced Configuration** (`appsettings.json`)
- StashApp connection settings
- GraphQL endpoint configuration
- API key authentication

### 4. **Updated Data Repository** (`Repositories/VideosRepository.cs`)
- Replaced static data with real StashApp queries
- Maintained all filtering and sorting capabilities
- Added pagination support

### 5. **Health Monitoring** (`Controllers/HealthController.cs`)
- Real-time StashApp connectivity checking
- Diagnostic endpoint for troubleshooting

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **Core PlayaVR v2 API**
- **Version endpoint**: Reports API version compatibility
- **Configuration endpoint**: Site branding and feature flags  
- **Videos listing**: Paginated video discovery with filtering
- **Video details**: Complete metadata including streams
- **Categories**: Tag-based content organization
- **Event tracking**: Analytics event handling

### ✅ **StashApp Integration**
- **GraphQL queries**: Efficient data fetching from StashApp
- **Authentication**: API key-based secure communication
- **Video streaming**: Direct proxy with range request support
- **Thumbnail serving**: Optimized image delivery
- **Real-time sync**: Live data from StashApp database

### ✅ **PlayaVR Compatibility**
- **CORS support**: Cross-origin requests for web clients
- **Video format detection**: Automatic quality mapping
- **Stream URL generation**: Bridge-hosted streaming endpoints
- **Response formatting**: Proper JSON structure for PlayaVR

## File Structure Changes

```
reference-app/src/
├── Controllers/
│   ├── VideosController.cs       # Updated with StashApp branding
│   ├── StreamController.cs       # NEW: Video streaming proxy
│   └── HealthController.cs       # NEW: Health monitoring
├── Services/
│   ├── IStashAppService.cs       # NEW: Service interface
│   └── StashAppService.cs        # NEW: StashApp integration
├── Model/
│   └── StashAppOptions.cs        # NEW: Configuration model
├── Repositories/
│   └── VideosRepository.cs       # Updated to use StashApp
├── appsettings.json              # Updated with StashApp config
└── Program.cs                    # Updated DI registration
```

## Configuration Required

Update `appsettings.json` with your StashApp details:

```json
{
  "StashApp": {
    "Url": "http://172.26.31.72:9969",
    "GraphQLUrl": "http://172.26.31.72:9969/graphql",
    "ApiKey": "your-stash-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **PlayaVR connects** to the bridge API (localhost:5000)
2. **Bridge fetches** video data from StashApp via GraphQL
3. **Video metadata** is converted to PlayaVR format
4. **Video streams** are proxied through the bridge with authentication
5. **Thumbnails** are served through the bridge for consistent access

## Compared to Original server.js

Your Node.js `server.js` had similar functionality but with a different approach:

| Feature | Your server.js | This C# Implementation |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **API Standard** | Custom PLAY'A v1 format | Official PlayaVR v2 API |
| **GraphQL** | ✅ Direct queries | ✅ Service-based queries |
| **Video Streaming** | ✅ Proxy with auth | ✅ Range request support |
| **Thumbnails** | ✅ Image resizing | ✅ Direct proxy |
| **Categories** | ✅ Tag mapping | ✅ Enhanced tag support |
| **Health Check** | ✅ Basic | ✅ Detailed diagnostics |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Comprehensive |

## Testing

1. **Build**: `dotnet build` 
2. **Run**: `dotnet run`
3. **Test**: `./test-bridge.sh`
4. **Connect PlayaVR**: Add `localhost:5000` as website

## Next Steps

1. **Configure StashApp connection** in appsettings.json
2. **Test endpoints** using the provided test script  
3. **Connect PlayaVR** to the bridge
4. **Optional enhancements**:
   - VR content detection based on tags
   - Advanced filtering options
   - Performance optimizations
   - Authentication support

The bridge is now ready to serve your StashApp content to PlayaVR with full v2 API compatibility!
